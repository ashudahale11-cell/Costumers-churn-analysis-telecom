- notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- outputs/ : Saved charts and figures
- ExploratoryDataAnalysis_EDA.md : Detailed EDA insights

## Key Outcome
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn
- Long-term contracts reduce churn
- Electronic check users churn the most
- Automatic payment methods reduce churn

## Outputs

The following visualizations were generated during Exploratory Data Analysis and saved in the `outputs/` folder:

- `contract_vs_churn.png` – Churn comparison across contract types
- `tenure_vs_churn.png` – Relationship between customer tenure and churn
- `payment_method_vs_churn.png` – Churn distribution by payment method
